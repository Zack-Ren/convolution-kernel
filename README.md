# convolution_kernel
This is an Image Processing program which applies filters to an image with the use of a convolution kernel.

How it works:
A .ppm image is read and it's pixel's RGB values are stored in an array. Using the given kernel, a filter is applied on the image via convolution. The processed image is then saved as an output.ppm file.
